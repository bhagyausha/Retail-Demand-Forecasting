# Demand Forecasting for Retail Stores

## Project Overview
This project builds a demand forecasting model to predict future sales for retail stores based on historical sales data. The model helps optimize inventory and workforce management by predicting the quantity of products needed at different times. It uses **machine learning** and **time series forecasting** techniques to make accurate predictions, which can improve operational efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` (for data manipulation)
  - `numpy` (for numerical operations)
  - `scikit-learn` (for machine learning models)
  - `statsmodels` (for time series forecasting)
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` (for data visualization)
  - `xgboost` (for demand prediction)
  - `jupyter` (for creating and running notebooks)
- **Data**: Retail Sales Dataset (can be sourced from Kaggle or create a synthetic dataset)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical sales data for various products across multiple retail stores. Key features include:
- `store_id`: Identifier for each store
- `product_id`: Identifier for each product
- `quantity_sold`: Number of items sold
- `price`: Price of the product
- `date`: Date of sale
- `day_of_week`: Day of the week the sale occurred
- `month`: Month of the sale
- `year`: Year of the sale

Example: 
```csv
store_id, product_id, date, quantity_sold, price, day_of_week, month, year
1, 101, 2022-01-01, 50, 19.99, Saturday, 1, 2022
1, 102, 2022-01-01, 30, 9.99, Saturday, 1, 2022
